# Bioinfo-TP: GenBank CDS Extractor

Final project for our Bioinformatics class

## Overview
This project provides tools for processing GenBank (.gb) DNA sequence files. It extracts coding sequences (CDS), translates them, and stores them in various formats.

## Features
- Extract CDS features from GenBank files
- Get the nucleotide sequence for each CDS
- Translate CDS sequences to protein sequences
- Store data in CSV and FASTA formats

## Usage
Run the script from the src directory:

```bash
cd src
python read_seq.py
```

Or, alternatively, simply run `get_fastas.sh`, which will handle dependencies and run the relevant python script. We recommend using a virtual environment for this.

This will:
1. Read the GenBank file from `../data/lep-sequence.gb`
2. Extract all CDS features
3. Print information about each CDS
4. Save the data to the `output` directory:
   - `cds_features.csv`: All CDS information in CSV format
   - `cds_sequences.fasta`: CDS nucleotide sequences in FASTA format
   - `protein_sequences.fasta`: Translated protein sequences in FASTA format

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Biopython
- pandas

# CHECK THIS LINE!
Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Automated pipeline

To run the entire analysis (preprocessing, BLAST search and multiple sequence
alignment) in one command, execute the `run_pipeline.sh` script from the project
root:

```bash
bash Run-1-2-3.sh
```

The script installs the required Python packages and sequentially runs:

1. `src/01-preprocess/read_seq.py`
2. `src/02-BLAST/blast_script.sh`
3. `src/03-msa/msa.sh`

Results will be stored inside the `outputs` directory.
